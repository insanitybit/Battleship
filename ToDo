Right now the majority of the core game works.

Next on this list:
* Allow a player to display opponents board. DONE
* There's a segfault when attacking. It should be very simple to address. DONE

*

* Implement inventory system. IN PROGRESS

* Validate input a lot more. Especially if this gets networked - right now I make tons of 
  assumptions about what information will end up in this. IN PROGRESS
